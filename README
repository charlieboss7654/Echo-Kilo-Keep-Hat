## Keep Hat On Script

A simple but essential FiveM script that ensures players keep their **currently worn hat** when entering any vehicle â€” including cars and bikes. This improves immersion and prevents GTA from auto-removing or auto-applying hats or helmets during vehicle entry animations.

## Features

- Keeps your **equipped hat** when entering vehicles

## Dependencies

- None

## Installation

1. Place the script folder (e.g., `keephat`) in your `resources/` directory.

2. Add the following line to your `server.cfg`:
   ensure EKS_Hat

3. Restart your server or resource.


## DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE SCRIPT FOLDER - DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE FXMANIFEST OR THE SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK
